## File organization

1. The 'wpp_sms' folder contains scripts that automatically generate messages, representing the attacker. There are two versions: a basic one and a more advanced one with higher complexity to mimic human behavior.

2. The "features_<file_pcap_name>" folders contain all the features from that capture. These folders are created when running '[proj.py](proj.py)' by commenting and uncommenting the following lines:

```python
NETClient = ['192.168.0.164']
file = 'Captures/5brsg1h30_lowFreq.pcap'
# file = 'Captures/4seq1h30.pcap'
# file = 'Captures/4smart1h30.pcap'
```

3. The "ResultadosPlot<BotType>" folders present the confusion matrices resulting from each machine learning method. These are generated by '[profileClass.py](profileClass.py)'.

## Installing Dependencies 

To execute these scripts, you need to create a virtual environment and install the required libraries:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Files

To run the basic and advanced bot scripts, refer to the dedicated README in: 

> [Link para o README na wpp_sms](wpp_sms/README.md)

To create the features, simply run the following line in the terminal:

```bash
python proj.py
```

Finally, to view the plot of the features, uncomment:

```python
viewerAllPlotsMixed(features, features_s, oClass, bot)
```

To view the confusion matrices, uncomment:

```python
calling_algoritmos(sil, pcaComponents_s,
                trainFeatures_browsing, testFeatures_browsing, i2train, i2test, o2train, o2test, 
                trainFeatures_attack,   testFeatures_atck,     i3train, i3test, o3train, o3test)
```

After uncommenting these lines as preferred, run the following line in the terminal:

```bash
python profileClass.py
```

As mentioned above, the data appears in the "ResultadosPlot<Sequential/Smart>" folders.
